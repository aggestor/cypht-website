        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Cypht has four differents installation ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Manual installation</li>
          <li>Installation within Tiki</li>
          <li>install using Docker (use cypht docker image)</li>
          <li>Install cypht on a YunoHost server</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please read the bellow explanations about each way and pick one of your choice.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>1. Manual installation</h2>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>Cypht requires at least PHP 5.6 for version 1.4.x, the Cypht 2.0 will require PHP 7.4,<a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer 2</a>, and at minimum the <a
                href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php">OpenSSL</a>, <a
                href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php">mbstring</a> and <a
                href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php">cURL</a> extensions. Cypht can also leverage several other
            extensions as defined in <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/composer.json#L37-L44">composer.json</a>.
            Testing is done on <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>
            platforms with <a href="http://nginx.com/">Nginx</a> and <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Before proceeding please make sure your system meets minimal requirements</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>1. Check minimum requirements</h4>
        <p>
        <pre>
#!/bin/bash

# You need to check php version which should be >=5.6
php --version

# Next you need to check composer version which should be >=2.0.0
composer --version

# List installed PHP extensions. at least OpenSSL, mbstring and cURL should be in the list
php -m</pre></p>
        <h4>2. Download and prepare the code</h4>
      <p>It's important to consider where you put the Cypht source. The web-server will need read-only access to it, and moving it from one place to another requires re-running the configuration script. Do NOT put the source in the document root as this could create a security risk. On Debian, it's common to use the /usr/local/share/ sub-directory for a situation like this. Here is short bash script that will download the latest code, setup the correct permissions and ownership, put the source in /usr/local/share/cypht, and create a default .env file. It requires sudo access:


      </p><pre>
#!/bin/bash

# this is where Cypht will be installed
DESTINATION="/usr/local/share/cypht"

# validate the destination directory
sudo test -r $DESTINATION -a -x $DESTINATION
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    sudo mkdir $DESTINATION
fi

# create working directory
mkdir cypht-temp
cd cypht-temp

# Fetch latest release information
$latest_release = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/cypht-org/cypht/releases/latest"

# Extract tag name of the latest release
$latest_tag = $latest_release.tag_name

# Construct download URL for the latest release within the 2.x series
$download_url = "https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/archive/refs/tags/$latest_tag.zip"

# Download the latest release
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $download_url -OutFile "latest_cypht_release.zip"

# unpack the archive
unzip latest_cypht_release.zip

# run composer
cd latest_cypht_release && composer install && cd ..

# create a .env file
cp latest_cypht_release/.env.example latest_cypht_release/.env

# fix permissions and ownership
find latest_cypht_release -type d -print | xargs chmod 755
find latest_cypht_release -type f -print | xargs chmod 644
sudo chown -R root:root latest_cypht_release

# copy to destination folder
sudo mv latest_cypht_release/* $DESTINATION

# remove working directory
cd ..
sudo rm -rf cypht-temp

</pre>
      <h4>3. Configure the program</h4>
      <p>To configure Cypht for your environment, make adjustments to the <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/.env.example">.env</a> file according to your preferences. The .env file serves as the primary configuration file.</p>

      <p>First edit the .env file to configure Cypht for your environment. If you choose to leverage a database for authentication, sessions, or user settings, ensure to complete the relevant sections within the .env file based on the information provided in the config/app.php file.</p>

      <p>The necessary SQL commands for creating tables can be found in the config/app.php file, specifically starting from line 617 in the "DB Sessions" section. </p>

      <p>Cypht needs read, and read-write access to a few directories on the server. For security reasons these should NOT be inside the web-server document root. A good place for these is under the /var/lib/ sub-directory. Here are the commands To create the required directories per the default values in the ini file (assuming your web-server software runs as the "www-data" user).</p>

      <pre>sudo mkdir /var/lib/hm3
sudo mkdir /var/lib/hm3/attachments
sudo mkdir /var/lib/hm3/users
sudo mkdir /var/lib/hm3/app_data

sudo chown -R www-data /var/lib/hm3/
      </pre>
      <p>The /var/lib/hm3/users directory is only required if you are using the file-system and not a database to store user settings (user_config_type = file in the .env). You can put these directories anywhere, just make sure the values in the ini file point to the right place.
      </p>
      <h4>4. Generate Dynamic Run-Time Configuration</h4>
      <p>Cypht utilizes a build process to create an optimized configuration and to combine and minimize page assets. Previously, after editing the hm3.ini file, the configuration and asset minimization were generated using the following steps:</p>

      <pre>cd /usr/local/share/cypht  (or wherever you put the code in section 1)
sudo php ./scripts/config_gen.php</pre>

      <p>Recent updates have streamlined the process, and running the command above will now specifically generate the config/dynamic.php file. This file incorporates dynamic configurations, including 'handler_modules,' 'output_modules,' and 'input_filters.' Furthermore, the command continues to optimize the configuration and combine/minimize page assets, ensuring efficient runtime operation.</p>

      <p>Additionally, executing this command will create a sub-directory called 'site' that contains the code and page assets required within the document root. If you ever relocate the source location, you'll need to re-run the config_gen script to update the program.</p>


      <h4>5. Enable the program in your web-server</h4>
      <p>The easiest way to serve Cypht is to symlink it to the web-server document root.  You can also copy the generated files to your web-server location, but then you will need to re-copy them anytime the config_gen script is run. If the source is located at /usr/local/share/cypht, and the web-server document root is at /var/www/html, the following command will make Cypht available under the "mail" path of the
      web-server:</p>

      <pre>sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/cypht/site /var/www/html/mail</pre>

      <p>Now going to https://your-server/mail/ should load the Cypht login page. Note that If you use a symlink, your web-server must be configured to follow symlinks.</p>
      <h4>6. Users</h4>
      <p>Setting up users depends on what type of authentication you configure in the config/app.php file. If you are using the local database configuration for users, there are scripts in the scripts/ directory to help manage them:
      <pre>
# create an account
php ./scripts/create_account.php username password

# delete an account
php ./scripts/delete_account.php username

# change an account password
php ./scripts/update_password.php username password</pre>
      </p>
      <h4>7. Debug mode</h4>
      <p>Cypht has a debug or developer mode that can be used to troubleshoot problems or enable faster development of modules. To enable the debug version of Cypht, just sym-link the entire source directory instead of the site sub-directory:</p>

      <pre>sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/cypht /var/www/html/mail-debug</pre>

      <p>Debug mode is not as efficient as the normal version, and it is NOT designed to be secure. DO NOT RUN DEBUG MODE IN PRODUCTION. You have been warned! Debug mode outputs lots of information to the PHP error log that can be useful for trouble-shooting problems. The location of the error log varies based on your php.ini settings and web-server software.</p>
      <h4>8. Other Configs files</h4>
      <p>Some Cypht modules necessitate additional configuration files for proper setup. It is crucial that these files are NOT located within the web-server document root. Certain modules may require configuration with a service provider, particularly those related to Oauth2 client setup (such as Github, WordPress, Oauth2 over IMAP for Gmail, and Outlook). After configuring related files, there is no need to rerun the config_gen script; the changes will be automatically merged into the main configuration settings.Alternatively, you can clear your app cache.
      <ul>
          <li><b>Github</b><p>Cypht can connect to github and aggregate notification data about repository activity.<br /><br />
              Example github.php file:<br />
              <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/github.php">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/github.php</a><br /><br />
              Authorize an application for github:<br />
              <a href="https://github.com/settings/developers">https://github.com/settings/developers</a>
              </p></li>
              <li><b>OAUTH2 over IMAP</b><p>Gmail and Outlook.com support OAUTH2 authentication over IMAP. This is preferable to normal IMAP authentication because Cypht never has access to your account password.<br /><br />
              Example oauth2.php file:<br />
              <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/oauth2.php">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/oauth2.php</a><br /><br />
              Authorize an application for gmail<br />
              <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/project">https://console.developers.google.com/project</a><br /><br />
              Authorize an application for outlook.com<br />
              <a href="https://account.live.com/developers/applications/">https://account.live.com/developers/applications/</a><br /><br />
              </p></li>
              <li><b>LDAP contacts</b><p>Cypht can use an LDAP server for contacts.<br /><br />
              Example ldap.php file:<br />
              <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/ldap.php">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/ldap.php</a><br /><br />
              </p></li>
              <li><b>WordPress</b><p>Cypht can aggregate WordPress.com notifications.<br /><br />
              Example wordpress.php file:<br />
              <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/wordpress.php">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/wordpress.php</a><br /><br />
              Authorize an application for WordPress.com:<br />
              <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/">https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/</a>
              </p></li>
              <li><b>Custom themes</b><p>You can create your own themes for Cypht. Edit the themes.php file to include your theme, and put the css file in modules/themes/assets.<br /><br />
              <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/themes.php">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/config/themes.php</a><br /><br />

      </ul>

      <h2>2. Install cypht using Docker</h2>
      <p>
        Using Docker is one of the easiest way to install cypht as the cypht docker image comes with all the steps required in the manual instalation done for you. But the bad news is that this instllation way requires docker knowledge.<br/>
        Here is the cypht docker repository: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sailfrog/cypht-docker">https://hub.docker.com/r/sailfrog/cypht-docker</a><br/>
        To run containers required by cypht, please, first make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed on your system, then take a look on the section "exemple docker-compose" of repository overview, then do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new directory on your system named as you want.</li>
        <li>In the directory created previously, create a file named "docker-compose.yaml"</li>
        <li>Open your CLI/terminal and move to the directory containning the docker-compose file and run the command to run containers <pre>docker-compose up -d</pre></li>
        <li>After containers started, you can access cypht on port 80 of your host if you didn't change the port value in the docker-compose file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NOTE: Please change usernames and passwords before using the given docker-compose code in your production environment.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Install Cypht on a YunoHost server</h2>
      <p>This is an other easy way of installing and use Cypht.<br>
          YunoHost is an operating system that aims to simplify server administration as much as possible to democratize self-hosting while remaining reliable,
        secure, ethical and lightweight. It is a free software project owned exclusively by volunteers. Technically, it can be seen as a distribution based on
        Debian GNU/Linux and can be installed on many types of hardware.<br/>
        To learn more about YunoHost, visit <a href="https://yunohost.org/en/overview/what_is_yunohost">https://yunohost.org/en/overview/what_is_yunohost</a>
      </p>
      <p>To install Cypht on YunoHost, please follow these steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you don't have an installed YunoHost server, please consult <a href="https://yunohost.org/#/install">the guide</a> to learn how to install it. If you have it, please go directly to the next step.</li>
        <li>If you just installed YunoHost or had it installed before, access your server and go to the admin dashboard, then click on "Applications"</li>
        <li>In the next page, click on the "install" button</li>
        <li>In the search area, enter "cypht"</li>
        <li>In the search result, click on cypht app</li>
        <li>Scroll down, then fill in the form according to your need or keep the default values, then clik on the "install" button. Note: Make sure the url value is not
          used by another app on the server or in case you have another cypht instance previously installed you have to modify it instead of using the default valuue.
        </li>
        <li>Once clicked on the "install" button, wait for the installation to complete, it may take while.</li>
        <li>Once the installation completed, you will be taking back to the dashboard.</li>
        <li>To open the app, click on the app recently installed and then on the "open the app" button, then the application opens in a new tab.</li>
        <li>Enter the username and admin password you've provided previously in the installation form and then click on the login button to enter cypht and start configuring your email accounts.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. Install Cypht within Tiki</h2>
      <p>If you have tiki installed, you can use Cypht within tiki. This is an easy way of installing Cypht.<br/>
