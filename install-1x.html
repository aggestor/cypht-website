        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>Cypht has four differents installation ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Manual installation</li>
          <li>Installation within Tiki</li>
          <li>install using Docker (use cypht docker image)</li>
          <li>Install cypht on a YunoHost server</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please read the bellow explanations about each way and pick one of your choice.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>1. Manual installation</h2>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>Cypht requires at least PHP 5.6 for version 1.4.x, the upcoming Cypht 2.0 will require PHP 7.4,<a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer 2</a>, and at minimum the <a
                href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php">OpenSSL</a>, <a
                href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php">mbstring</a> and <a
                href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php">cURL</a> extensions. Cypht can also leverage several other
            extensions as defined in <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/composer.json#L37-L44">composer.json</a>.
            Testing is done on <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>
            platforms with <a href="http://nginx.com/">Nginx</a> and <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Before proceeding please make sure your system meets minimal requirements</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>1. Check minimum requirements</h4>
        <p>
        <pre>
#!/bin/bash

# You need to check php version which should be >=5.6 for version 1.4.x and 7.4 for upcoming Cypht version 2.0
php --version

# Next you need to check composer version which should be >=2.0.0
composer --version

# List installed PHP extensions. at least OpenSSL, mbstring and cURL should be in the list
php -m</pre>
    </p>
    <h4>2. Download and prepare the code</h4>
    <p>It's important to consider where you put the Cypht source. The web-server will need read-only access to it, and
        moving it from one place to another requires re-running the configuration script. Do NOT put the source in the
        document root as this could create a security risk. On Debian, it's common to use the /usr/local/share/
        sub-directory for a situation like this. Here is short bash script that will download the latest code, setup the
        correct permissions and ownership, put the source in /usr/local/share/cypht, and create a default hm3.ini file.
        It requires sudo access:


    </p>
    <pre>
#!/bin/bash

# this is where Cypht will be installed
DESTINATION="/usr/local/share/cypht"

# validate the destination directory
sudo test -r $DESTINATION -a -x $DESTINATION
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    sudo mkdir $DESTINATION
fi

# create working directory
mkdir cypht-temp
cd cypht-temp

# grab latest code
wget https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/archive/1.4.x.zip

# unpack the archive
unzip 1.4.x.zip

# run composer
cd cypht-1.4.x && composer install && cd ..

# create a vanilla ini file
cp cypht-1.4.x/hm3.sample.ini cypht-1.4.x/hm3.ini

# fix permissions and ownership
find cypht-1.4.x -type d -print | xargs chmod 755
find cypht-1.4.x -type f -print | xargs chmod 644
sudo chown -R root:root cypht-1.4.x

# copy to destination folder
sudo mv cypht-1.4.x/* $DESTINATION

# remove working directory
cd ..
sudo rm -rf cypht-temp</pre>
    <h4>3. Configure the program</h4>
    <p>To configure Cypht for your environment, you must first edit the <a
            href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/hm3.sample.ini">hm3.ini</a> file to your liking, then
        run the config_gen.php script to generate the optimized configuration file and assets used at run-time.</p>

    <p>First edit the hm3.ini file to configure Cypht for your environment. If you choose to use a database for any of
        the 3 available purposes (authentication, sessions, or user settings), you will need to complete the "DB
        support" section and create the required tables. SQL to do so can be found in the hm3.sample.ini file. The ini
        file has lots of comments explaining what each option does.</p>

    <p>Cypht needs read, and read-write access to a few directories on the server. For security reasons these should NOT
        be inside the web-server document root. A good place for these is under the /var/lib/ sub-directory. Here are
        the commands To create the required directories per the default values in the ini file (assuming your web-server
        software runs as the "www-data" user).</p>

    <pre>sudo mkdir /var/lib/hm3
sudo mkdir /var/lib/hm3/attachments
sudo mkdir /var/lib/hm3/users
sudo mkdir /var/lib/hm3/app_data
sudo chown -R www-data /var/lib/hm3/</pre>
        <p>The "/var/lib/hm3/users" directory is only required if you are using the file-system and not a database to store
        user settings (user_config_type = file in the hm3.ini). You can put these directories anywhere, just make sure
        the values in the ini file point to the right place.
    </p>
    <h4>4. Generate the run-time configuration</h4>
    <p>Cypht uses a build process to create an optimized configuration, and to combine and minimize page assets. Once
        you have edited your hm3.ini file, generate the configuration with:</p>

    <pre>cd /usr/local/share/cypht  (or wherever you put the code in section 1)
sudo php ./scripts/config_gen.php</pre>

    <p>This will create a sub-directory called site that contains the code and page assets that need to be inside the
        document root, and it creates an optimized configuration file called hm3.rc in the current directory. Anytime
        you change the ini file settings, or move the source location, you will need to re-run the config_gen script to
        update the program.</p>


    <h4>5. Enable the program in your web-server</h4>
    <p>The easiest way to serve Cypht is to symlink it to the web-server document root. You can also copy the generated
        files to your web-server location, but then you will need to re-copy them anytime the config_gen script is run.
        If the source is located at /usr/local/share/cypht, and the web-server document root is at /var/www/html, the
        following command will make Cypht available under the "mail" path of the
        web-server:</p>

    <pre>sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/cypht/site /var/www/html/mail</pre>

    <p>Now going to https://your-server/mail/ should load the Cypht login page. Note that If you use a symlink, your
        web-server must be configured to follow symlinks.</p>
    <h4>6. Users</h4>
    <p>Setting up users depends on what type of authentication you configure in the hm3.ini file. If you are using the
        local database configuration for users, there are scripts in the scripts/ directory to help manage them:
    <pre>
# create an account
php ./scripts/create_account.php username password

# delete an account
php ./scripts/delete_account.php username

# change an account password
php ./scripts/update_password.php username password</pre>
    </p>
    <h4>7. Debug mode</h4>
    <p>Cypht has a debug or developer mode that can be used to troubleshoot problems or enable faster development of
        modules. To enable the debug version of Cypht, just sym-link the entire source directory instead of the site
        sub-directory:</p>

    <pre>sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/cypht /var/www/html/mail-debug</pre>

    <p>Debug mode is not as efficient as the normal version, and it is NOT designed to be secure. DO NOT RUN DEBUG MODE
        IN PRODUCTION. You have been warned! Debug mode outputs lots of information to the PHP error log that can be
        useful for trouble-shooting problems. The location of the error log varies based on your php.ini settings and
        web-server software.</p>
    <h4>8. Other INI files</h4>
    <p>Some Cypht modules require additional ini files to be configured. These should NOT be inside the web-server
        document root. Cypht will look for them in the location defined by "app_data_dir" in the hm3.ini file. A sample
        ini file for each module set that requires one is included in the source for that module. To configure them you
        must copy the sample ini file to the "app_data_dir" and edit it for your setup. Some of these require
        configuring your service with a provider, specifically ones related to Oauth2 client setup (Github, WordPress,
        Oauth2 over IMAP for Gmail and Outlook). Re-run the config_gen script after configuring an ini file and it will
        be merged into the main configuration settings.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Github</b>
            <p>Cypht can connect to github and aggregate notification data about repository activity.<br/>
                Example github.ini file:<br/>
                <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/github/github.ini">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/github/github.ini</a><br/><br/>
                Authorize an application for github:<br/>
                <a href="https://github.com/settings/developers">https://github.com/settings/developers</a>
            </p></li>
        <li><b>OAUTH2 over IMAP</b>
            <p>Gmail and Outlook.com support OAUTH2 authentication over IMAP. This is preferable to normal IMAP
                authentication because Cypht never has access to your account password.<br/><br/>
                Example oauth2 ini file:<br/>
                <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/imap/oauth2.ini">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/imap/oauth2.ini</a><br/><br/>
                Authorize an application for gmail<br/>
                <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/project">https://console.developers.google.com/project</a><br/><br/>
                Authorize an application for outlook.com<br/>
                <a href="https://account.live.com/developers/applications/">https://account.live.com/developers/applications/</a><br/><br/>
            </p></li>
        <li><b>LDAP contacts</b>
            <p>Cypht can use an LDAP server for contacts.<br/><br/>
                Example ldap.ini file:<br/>
                <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/ldap_contacts/ldap.ini">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/ldap_contacts/ldap.ini</a><br/><br/>
            </p></li>
        <li><b>WordPress</b>
            <p>Cypht can aggregate WordPress.com notifications.<br/><br/>
                Example wordpress.ini file:<br/>
                <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/wordpress/wordpress.ini">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/wordpress/wordpress.ini</a><br/><br/>
                Authorize an application for WordPress.com:<br/>
                <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/">https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/</a>
            </p></li>
        <li><b>Custom themes</b>
            <p>You can create your own themes for Cypht. Edit the themes.ini file to include your theme, and put the css
                file in modules/themes/assets.</p><br/>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/themes/themes.ini">https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/1.4.x/modules/themes/themes.ini</a>
            </p>
        </li>

    </ul>

      <h2>2. Install cypht using Docker</h2>
      <p>
        Using Docker is one of the easiest way to install cypht as the cypht docker image comes with all the steps required in the manual instalation done for you. But the bad news is that this instllation way requires docker knowledge.<br/>
        Here is the cypht docker repository: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sailfrog/cypht-docker">https://hub.docker.com/r/sailfrog/cypht-docker</a><br/>
        To run containers required by cypht, please, first make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed on your system, then take a look on the section "exemple docker-compose" of repository overview, then do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new directory on your system named as you want.</li>
        <li>In the directory created previously, create a file named "docker-compose.yaml"</li>
        <li>Open your CLI/terminal and move to the directory containning the docker-compose file and run the command to run containers <pre>docker-compose up -d</pre></li>
        <li>After containers started, you can access cypht on port 80 of your host if you didn't change the port value in the docker-compose file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NOTE: Please change usernames and passwords before using the given docker-compose code in your production environment.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Install Cypht on a YunoHost server</h2>
      <p>This is an other easy way of installing and use Cypht.<br>
          YunoHost is an operating system that aims to simplify server administration as much as possible to democratize self-hosting while remaining reliable,
        secure, ethical and lightweight. It is a free software project owned exclusively by volunteers. Technically, it can be seen as a distribution based on
        Debian GNU/Linux and can be installed on many types of hardware.<br/>
        To learn more about YunoHost, visit <a href="https://yunohost.org/en/whatsyunohost">https://yunohost.org/en/whatsyunohost</a>
      </p>
      <p>To install Cypht on YunoHost, please follow these steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you don't have an installed YunoHost server, please consult <a href="https://yunohost.org/#/install">the guide</a> to learn how to install it. If you have it, please go directly to the next step.</li>
        <li>If you just installed YunoHost or had it installed before, access your server and go to the admin dashboard, then click on "Applications"</li>
        <li>In the next page, click on the "install" button</li>
        <li>In the search area, enter "cypht"</li>
        <li>In the search result, click on cypht app</li>
        <li>Scroll down, then fill in the form according to your need or keep the default values, then clik on the "install" button. Note: Make sure the url value is not
          used by another app on the server or in case you have another cypht instance previously installed you have to modify it instead of using the default valuue.
        </li>
        <li>Once clicked on the "install" button, wait for the installation to complete, it may take while.</li>
        <li>Once the installation completed, you will be taking back to the dashboard.</li>
        <li>To open the app, click on the app recently installed and then on the "open the app" button, then the application opens in a new tab.</li>
        <li>Enter the username and admin password you've provided previously in the installation form and then click on the login button to enter cypht and start configuring your email accounts.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. Install Cypht within Tiki</h2>
      <p>If you have tiki installed, you can use Cypht within tiki. This is an easy way of installing Cypht.<br/>
